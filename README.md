# plantTracker

plantTracker is a mobile app built with React Native Expo CLI that allows real-time monitoring and tracking of crucial plant growth parameters. It integrates with an Arduino-based hardware setup, including sensors for measuring soil moisture, light intensity, and temperature, to provide users with valuable insights into their plant's environmental conditions.

## Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, light intensity, and temperature.
- Data visualization for easy tracking of plant growth trends.
- Sensor calibration for accurate readings.
- Django server integration for data storage and retrieval.
- Push notifications and alerts for timely plant care actions.
- User-friendly UI for sensor configuration and customization.
- Historical data visualization for data-driven decision-making.
- Pump control integration for remote watering or nutrient application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher) installed on your system.
- Expo CLI installed globally. If not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli

```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plantTracker.git
cd plantTracker

npm install
```

### Configuration

Update the Django server URL in the `src/config.js` file with the appropriate URL of your Django server.

```javascript
// src/config.js

const config = {
  // Update the Django server URL here
  SERVER_URL: "http://your-django-server-url.com",
  DEVICE_ID: "id",
};

export default config;
```

Follow the hardware setup instructions in the project documentation to set up the Arduino-based hardware with sensors for soil moisture, light intensity, and temperature.

### Run the App

```bash
expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server and open the Expo DevTools in your default web browser. You can then run the app on an emulator, simulator, or a physical device using the Expo Go app.
